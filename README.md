# Virtual Teaching Setup

This page documents my setup for virtual teaching in Fall 2020. I teach Machine Learning Engineering at Cornell Tech with about 110 registered students. The course is taught in 3 1-hour sessions at 11 am Tues/Thurs and 9pm on Thurs (for international student equity). 

## Constraints

* I wanted to teach in an interactive mode. Many of my colleagues swear by the flipped classroom setting.

* I live in a ~700 sq ft 1 bedroom apartment in NY. My partner uses the main room, so I teach out of the bedroom. So I roughly have a 4 foot x 5 foot space. 

* I have a relatively nice linux desktop from https://system76.com/ so I wanted to teach remotely through that. 


## Equipment

I spent roughly $500 on additional equipment for teaching.
